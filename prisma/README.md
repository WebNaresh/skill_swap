## Usage Examples

### Creating a User

```typescript
const user = await prisma.user.create({
  data: {
    email: "john@example.com",
    name: "John Doe",
    profileImage: "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/...",
    location: {
      city: "San Francisco",
      state: "California",
      country: "United States",
      isPublic: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### Finding Skills by Category

```typescript
const techSkills = await prisma.skillOffered.findMany({
  where: {
    category: "TECHNOLOGY",
    isActive: true,
    isPublic: true,
  },
  include: {
    user: {
      select: {
        name: true,
        profileImage: true,
        location: true,
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Creating a Skill Exchange

```typescript
const exchange = await prisma.skillExchange.create({
  data: {
    teacherId: "teacher-user-id",
    learnerId: "learner-user-id",
    offeredSkillId: "offered-skill-id",
    wantedSkillId: "wanted-skill-id",
    title: "React Development for Guitar Lessons",
    format: "HYBRID",
    estimatedHours: 20,
  },
});
```

### Creating Detailed Availability

```typescript
const availability = await prisma.availability.create({
  data: {
    userId: "user-id",
    skillOfferedId: "skill-id", // Optional: specific to a skill
    daysOfWeek: ["MONDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "FRIDAY"],
    timeSlots: ["EVENING"],
    sessionDuration: "TWO_HOURS",
    timezone: "America/Los_Angeles",
    isRecurring: true,
    validFrom: new Date("2024-02-01"),
    validUntil: new Date("2024-12-31"),
    specificDates: [
      {
        date: "2024-02-15",
        startTime: "19:00",
        endTime: "21:00",
        note: "Special extended session",
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

### Finding Users with Matching Availability

```typescript
const matchingUsers = await prisma.user.findMany({
  where: {
    isPrivate: false,
    isActive: true,
    availabilities: {
      some: {
        daysOfWeek: { has: "MONDAY" },
        timeSlots: { has: "EVENING" },
        timezone: "America/Los_Angeles",
        isActive: true,
      },
    },
  },
  include: {
    skillsOffered: {
      where: { isActive: true, isPublic: true },
    },
    availabilities: {
      where: { isActive: true },
    },
  },
});
```

## Migration Commands

```bash
# Generate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Push schema to database
npx prisma db push

# View database in Prisma Studio
npx prisma studio
```

## Security Considerations

- All user data includes proper cascade deletion
- Unique constraints prevent duplicate ratings
- Public/private visibility controls on skills and ratings
- User verification status tracking
- Flexible location privacy controls
